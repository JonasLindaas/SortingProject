# SortingProject
The goal of the sorting project is to completely redesign and modularise my existing sorter program, and to expand it with more features.

## MVP
- **Modular Sorting** 

  Supports Using different sorting algorithms if so desired

- **Improved Parsing**

  Parsing doesn't break if input is incomplete/incorrect
  
  Parsing can interpret certain sub-strings as scores or *Modifiers* 
  
  Parser is modular and can easily read from multiple sources
    
    - Input Stream Supported
    - (More in the future (read from txt file, direct discord read?))
  
- **Modifiers**
